## What I’m into

- **Smart home automation** (Home Assistant as the orchestration layer)
- **Hardware + software integration** (sensors, webhooks, MQTT)
- **Maker work** (3D printing, laser cutting/engraving, design + prototyping)
- **Plant care automation** (because the plants deserve uptime too)

## Personal rule

> If it’s not automatable, it’s not done yet.
