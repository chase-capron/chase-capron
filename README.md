## Focus

- **Home automation** (Home Assistant as orchestration)
- **Hardware ↔ software integration** (MQTT, webhooks, sensors, dashboards)
- **Tooling that ships** (small surface area, good defaults, maintainable repos)

---

## Now

- Hardening and simplifying Home Assistant workflows
- Building assistant tooling and repo references to speed up iteration

---

## Philosophy

> Make it boring to operate.
